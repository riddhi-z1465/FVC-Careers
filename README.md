## Setup & Running

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/riddhi-z1465/FVC-Careers.git
    cd FVC-Careers
    ```

2.  **Open the project**:
    You can simply open `index.html` in your browser. For the best experience (and to avoid CORS issues with file uploads), use a local development server.

    Using VS Code Live Server:
    *   Right-click `index.html`
    *   Select "Open with Live Server"

3.  **Firebase Configuration**:
    *   The project expects a `js/firebase-config.js` file.
    *   If missing, create one with your Firebase project credentials:
        ```javascript
        const firebaseConfig = {
            apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
            authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com",
            projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
            storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT.appspot.com",
            messagingSenderId: "...",
            appId: "..."
        };
        firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
        const db = firebase.firestore();
        const storage = firebase.storage();
        ```

## HR Access
*   Access the HR portal at `/hr-login.html`.
*   Standard credentials (configurable in `hr-login.js`).

## Recent Updates
*   **Frontend**: Fixed styling inconsistencies and refined the search form design.
*   **Search**: Implemented a pill-shaped, centered search bar with visual enhancements.
*   **Functionality**: Fixed "Delete Job" and "Manage Job" buttons in HR dashboard.
*   **Data**: Enhanced data persistence logic to seamlessly handle hybrid cloud/local states.
